The script is simple, no arguments and it checks your machines IP, or pass an
IP to see if it is in the database. Example output:

    $ hackcheck.pl
    146.231.115.12 is Safe
    $ hackcheck.pl 0.0.0.0
    0.0.0.0 is Hacked : It appears 157,699 times.

You can run this regularly to be notified if a machine you administer shows up.
The cron script is very simple. Just drop it into /etc/cron.daily or the like.

    #!/bin/sh
    test -f /usr/bin/hackcheck.pl || exit 0

    MAILTO=root

    #Put the IP address of the machine you want checked here
    IP=0.0.0.0

    [ -z "$MAILTO" ] && exit 1

    hackcheck.pl $IP > /dev/null
    if [ "$?" -eq "1" ]; then
            hackcheck.pl $IP| \
            mail -e -s "DShield Hack Warning \
            on $(hostname -f) [$(date +%D)]" $MAILTO
    fi
